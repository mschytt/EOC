# Linear-Quadratic Elliptic Optimal Control
Single script containing implementations of both the conditioned gradient method and projected gradient descent. They are used to solve a fabricated optimal control problem goverened by an elliptic partial differential equations. This implementation makes extensive use of FEniCS (see https://fenicsproject.org/).
